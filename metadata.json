{"author":"Soma","description":"We invite you to volunteer your spare Twitter account to help us archive Twitter by the keyword of your preference. This initiative is a not-for-profit endeavor, sponsored by the Koii Foundation. Before participating, please ensure that your volunteer Twitter account has passed the verification process. Rewards are calculated based on the amount of time your node remains online. The longer you stay online, the greater the reward you will receive. The base bounty per round is 3000 KOII, which will be divided among users who have made submissions in the last round. It's a good idea to use a secondary Twitter account for this project to maintain the smooth functioning of your main account.","repositoryUrl":"https://github.com/koii-network/task-X","createdAt":1723227129588,"migrationDescription":"Fixed Login Issue","imageUrl":"https://bafybeienjq6idlhd7zwpdoqj2pdzjbomntfcg76dr5in5qeqkw2zczrrfi.ipfs.w3s.link/x-task.png","requirementsTags":[{"type":"TASK_VARIABLE","value":"TWITTER_USERNAME","description":"The username of your volunteer Twitter account.
